# UnityProjects

Welcome to the UnityProjects repository! This is a collection of Unity projects demonstrating various concepts and tools related to game development and visualization. Feel free to explore the different projects and understand how they are structured and implemented.

## Projects

### NeRF

An experimental project exploring Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) within Unity. This project demonstrates how neural representations of 3D scenes can be rendered in real-time using Unity's powerful rendering capabilities.

### NeRF_Build

The build configurations and assets for deploying the NeRF project. It contains all necessary files to build and run the NeRF project on different platforms.

### Transformer

The Transformer project is a visualization tool designed to represent the Transformer architecture - an advanced AI algorithm widely used in natural language processing tasks. This tool aims to make the complex workings of the Transformer model more accessible and understandable through visual representation.
